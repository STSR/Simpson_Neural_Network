# Simpson_Neural_Network
This is the final project for CMPE 452. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate our understanding of neural networks and genetic algorithms by applying them in a practical problem. The challenge the team chose to undertake was to predict which Simpons character was being shown to the neural network.
