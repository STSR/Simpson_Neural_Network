# Simpson Character Neural Network Image Analysis
This is the final project for CMPE 452. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate our understanding of neural networks and genetic algorithms by applying them in a practical problem. The challenge the team chose to undertake was to predict which Simpons character was being shown to the neural network. This was handled in four different ways using three different technologies. In this repository, there is the report for this project as well as the four different models used in predicting the Simpons characters. A lot of credit is owed to alexattia, https://github.com/alexattia/SimpsonRecognition.git, for having the usable data as well as his TenserFlow model.
